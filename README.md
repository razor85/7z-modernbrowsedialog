Hey, this is just a copy of 7z-1604 repository with a single change: The 'Browse Folder Dialog' is replaced by the modern dialog version (available on Windows Vista). 
This file was compiled targeting Windows 10 but you can change the _WIN32_WINNT flag on the headers to whatever you want (Vista+). Yikes!
